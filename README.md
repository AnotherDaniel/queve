# QUality EVEnt Engine (quevee) github action

This action accepts a set of input URLs pointing to release artifacts of various categories (like 'documentation' or 'testing'), and creates a toml file that contains project and release metadata as well as the artifact URLs. The goal is to document release artifacts that are relevant for assessment of project quality aspects, and present them for evaluation and archival in quality assessment processes.

### `artifacts_readme`

### `artifacts_requirements`

Comma-separated list of URLs of requirement files.

### `artifacts_testing`

Comma-separated list of URLs of test results.

## Outputs

### `manifest_file`

## Example usage

__Note__: github action variables contain URLs generated by previous steps like 'create release' or 'upload file to release'.
